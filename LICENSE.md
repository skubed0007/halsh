# Joay License  
**Version 1.5**

This Software is licensed under the **Joay License**, which governs the rights and responsibilities of anyone who interacts with the Software. By downloading, installing, using, modifying, or distributing the Software, you agree to these terms. If you disagree, you must cease all use immediately.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **Granter:**  
  Refers to the original creator(s) or copyright holder(s) of the  
  Software.  
  *Explanation:* This term covers anyone who has legal rights to the  
  Software as initially released. No other individual or entity can claim  
  to be the primary owner unless explicitly stated.

- **Software:**  
  Refers to the entire original work provided under this License,  
  including its source code, documentation, configuration files, and any  
  associated materials.  
  *Explanation:* This encompasses every part of the project as it is  
  originally distributed—and any authorized updates—ensuring that all  
  related content is covered under these terms.

- **You:**  
  Refers to any individual, organization, or entity that downloads, installs,  
  uses, modifies, or distributes the Software under the terms of this License.  
  *Explanation:* This ensures that all parties interacting with the Software  
  are bound by the same obligations and rights as laid out in this document.

- **Commercial Use:**  
  Refers to any activity primarily intended to generate revenue or financial  
  gain from the use of the Software. This includes selling products or  
  services that incorporate or rely on the Software.  
  However, the following uses are explicitly permitted even if revenue is  
  generated:  
  - **Development Tool Exception:** Using the Software as a development tool  
    to create a separate commercial product is allowed, provided that the  
    Software’s code is not directly incorporated into that product.  
  - **Incidental Revenue Exception:** Generating incidental revenue—such as  
    through advertisements or sponsorships—on free or educational content  
    is allowed.  
  *Explanation:* This definition is designed to prevent the direct  
  commercialization of the Software itself while allowing its use as an  
  enabling tool. It carefully distinguishes between revenue obtained directly  
  from the Software and incidental gains from related activities.

- **Derivative Work:**  
  Refers to any work based on the Software, including modifications,  
  enhancements, or adaptations. For the purposes of this License, a  
  Derivative Work is defined as any work that incorporates 20% or more (by  
  line count) of the original Software's code.  
  *Explanation:* This definition ensures that minor integrations or uses  
  of the Software as a tool do not automatically subject the new work to  
  the same licensing terms. Only substantial use of the original code  
  triggers the obligations set for Derivative Works.

- **Cure Period:**  
  Refers to the 15-day period following notification of a violation of  
  this License during which the violating party has an opportunity to remedy  
  the breach.  
  *Explanation:* This period provides a practical window to address and fix  
  any non-compliance issues. If the violation is not fully resolved within  
  these 15 days, the rights granted under the License will be terminated.

## 12. Termination of Licenses for Third-Party Software

This section explains, in very simple words, what happens if any other software  
(called "Third-Party Software") uses this Software and causes any harm to the  
Granter. It tells you what "harm" means, what steps will be taken, and that no  
other parts of this License will be used in these cases.

### 12.1 What is "Third-Party Software"?

- **Third-Party Software (Other Software):**  
  This means any software, program, or app that uses this Software. It does  
  not matter if the Software runs separately (like a tool) or if parts of it  
  are mixed directly into the other software.

- **Utilization Modes:**
  - **Using as a Tool:** The other software runs this Software as a separate  
    program to help it work.
  - **Direct Incorporation:** The other software takes parts of this Software’s  
    code or functions and mixes them into its own code.

### 12.2 What Does "Harm" Mean?

- **Harm** means any negative effect that causes problems for the Granter. This  
  includes, but is not limited to:
  - **Financial Loss:** Losing money directly because of how the Software is used.
  - **Damage to Reputation:** The Granter’s good name being hurt.
  - **Security Problems:** Creating risks or bugs that may make the Software unsafe.
  - **Operational Problems:** Stopping or disturbing the normal work of the Granter.
- **Important:**  
  The harm must be a real and reasonable problem. It must not be based on  
  personal complaints like "my pockets are getting empty" unless that loss  
  directly causes a clear and real problem for the Granter.

### 12.3 What is the "Cure Period"?

- **Cure Period** is defined as a period of **15 days** given to the owner of the  
  Third-Party Software to remedy any harm caused.
- This period begins when the Granter sends a clear written notice that includes:
  - The required remedial options to fix the harm, or
  - A clear statement that no remedial options are provided (if the Granter chooses  
    not to offer any).
- All remedial options provided must be reasonable and include only remedies that  
  the owner of the Third-Party Software can feasibly opt for.
- This 15-day period represents the only time allowed to remedy the issue. The period  
  starts as soon as the notice is issued—whether that notice is sent as a direct  
  communication (like a letter or email) or published on a public forum that meets the  
  requirements below.

### Acknowledged Platforms for Posting Notice (and Possible Options for Remedies)

#### 12.3.1 Public Posting Platforms

For the purposes of this License, the following platforms are recognized as widely  
known and effective for posting and sharing the License or related content. Each  
platform has specific requirements to ensure that the License is seen and spread by  
a large, active audience.

1. **Discord Server**  
   - **What It Means:** You can post the License on a Discord server.
   - **Requirements:**  
     - **Large and Public:** The Discord server must be a large, public server with many  
       active members who care about the topic and are likely to share the information quickly.
   - **Why This Matters:** A large public server ensures that the License reaches many people,  
     allowing for rapid and widespread distribution.

2. **X (Formerly Known as Twitter)**  
   - **What It Means:** You can post the License on X.
   - **Requirements:**  
     - **Mention the Third-Party Owner:** When posting on X, you must clearly mention the  
       third-party owner of the platform.
     - **Active Operation on X:** The posting will only be counted if the third-party owner  
       actually operates on X. If they do not have an active presence on X, then the post  
       will not be considered valid under this License.

3. **Reddit**  
   - **What It Means:** You can post the License on Reddit.
   - **Requirements:**  
     - **Large and Public Subreddit:** The License must be posted in a large, public subreddit  
       with a high number of active users who are engaged in the topic and capable of spreading  
       the License quickly.
   - **Why This Matters:** Posting in a large, active subreddit increases the reach and visibility  
     of the License, ensuring that it is shared and discussed among a wide audience.

> Other platforms may be qualified only if the third-party owner is regularly active on them.

#### 12.3.2 Email

- A written email detailing the notice and remedial options must be sent to the owner of the  
  Third-Party Software.

#### 12.3.3 Automatic Start of the Cure Period

- After sending the notice, the 15-day cure period will start automatically even if there is no  
  response from the Third-Party Software owner.
- **Exception:** This automatic start does not apply in cases where the owner has communicated  
  valid reasons (such as health or financial issues) for delay.

### 12.4 The Steps for Termination and the Cure Process

1. **Step 1: Written Notice or Public Post**  
   On the first day (Day 1), the Granter will send a written notice or make a public post that  
   follows the guidelines in Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2. This notice must include:
   - A clear, simple explanation of what harm has been caused.
   - A clear reason that shows why this harm is a problem, using simple and reasonable words.
   - **At least two simple and reasonable remedial options** (ways to fix the harm) that the owner  
     of the Third-Party Software can choose from.
   - **OR**, if the Granter does not want to give any options, the notice must clearly state,  
     "No remedial options are given."
   - Once the notice is posted on a public forum, it may not be edited. Follow-up notices are permitted  
     only if the third-party owner opts for them; otherwise, only the original notice applies.
   
2. **Step 2: Beginning the Cure Period**  
   The 15-day cure period starts as soon as the written notice is sent with the required remedial  
   options (or the clear statement that there are no options).

3. **Step 3: Remedying the Harm**  
   During the 15-day cure period, the owner of the Third-Party Software must choose one of the provided  
   options or follow any clear instructions given by the Granter to fix the harm.  
   - The goal is to remedy the harm in a way that is acceptable to the Granter.

4. **Step 4: Failure to Remedy**  
   If, by the end of the 15-day cure period, the harm has not been remedied to the Granter's satisfaction,  
   the license that allowed the Third-Party Software to use this Software will be terminated immediately.  
   - This means that the Third-Party Software must stop using this Software right after the cure period ends if  
     the harm is not remedied.

### 12.5 Final Decision and Overriding Other Rules

- **Final Decision:**  
  Once the 15-day cure period is over, if the harm is not remedied, the Granter’s decision to terminate the  
  license is final. No further opportunities to remedy the issue will be provided under this section.

- **Other Rules Do Not Apply:**  
  For any actions taken under this Section 12, all other sections or rules in this License do not apply.  
  This means that even if other parts of this License usually grant rights or impose obligations, they are  
  not used in cases of termination under this section. Only the rules in Section 12 will be followed.
